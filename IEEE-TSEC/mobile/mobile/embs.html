<h2><a name="itembs"></a>IEEE-TSEC EMBS</h2>
 <p>
      IEEE-TSEC EMBS is one of the oldest biomedical societies in Mumbai.
	  The society also conducts a hospital or research institute visit HELIX 
	  and publishes its own newsletter Biobytes. Its field of interest ranges
	  from providing its members access to the latest developments in medical 
	  and clinical industrial trials and applications, to advancing medicine 
	  and biology through the application of engineering sciences and technology.
	  </p>
    
    <h4>HELIX:</h4>
    <p>
It is an annual hospital or research centre visit. 
It is one of the highlights of IEEE-TSEC EMBS. It gives 
students an insight into the new advancements in the biotechnical 
and biomedical world. Students also get a chance of interacting with
 the experts of the respective field.</p>

      <h4>CEREBRATION:</h4>
      <p>
CEREBRATION is an annual inter collegiate festival 
held at the start of the academic year, in the even
 semester. It includes seminars and workshops which 
 are taken up by highly qualified professionals from 
 renowned firms/hospitals/institutes. It also conducts a 
 few contests as a part of this event. </p>
        
        <h4> PULSE</h4>
        <p>
The odd semester event of IEEE-TSEC EMBS  is 'PULSE'.
The volunteers organized the festival which comprised of a seminar and a fun-event. </p>

<h2><a name="events"></a>EVENTS</h2>
<h4>HELIX</h4>
<i>HELIX 2015</i>
<br><br>
Helix 2015 was a laboratory visit to ICT(Institute of Chemical Technology) where we checked the purity of samples , instruments that converted biomass into simple sugars. They even showed various algae that they store and purity and make biomass of it. There was even a fermentation lab where we learned about the use of fermenter. 
<br><br>

<i> HELIX 2014:</i>
      <p>
Helix 2014 was a laboratory visit to TIFR(TATA INSTITUTE OF FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH) where students were shown high-tech medical instruments and the professors showed them how they actually worked in the biochemistry and stem cell departments. This being one of the very few opportunities wherein students get a chance to visit any laboratory; and moreover getting a chance to see the working laboratory right in front of them, they were very contended. 
</p>
        <br/>
		
		<i> HELIX 2013:</i>
      <p>
Helix 2013 was a hospital visit to the renowned Tata Memorial Hospital. It not only helped the students in getting a better exposure to practical science but also gave them a firsthand experience about the innovations happening in the progressive biotechnological world. This year we are also publishing news letters called Biobytes, consisting of various innovative articles about upcoming technologies in the vast field of biology. 
</p>
        <br/>

    <i> HELIX 2012:</i>
      <p>
It consisted of a visit to the Genetic Research Centre in Mumbai, India.
 Here students gained knowledge about various advanced techniques and 
 equipments used in DNA sequencing. The study of the genetic history of a
 family tree was examined. Students got a chance to discuss the future of 
 biotechnology in India with the experts.</p>
