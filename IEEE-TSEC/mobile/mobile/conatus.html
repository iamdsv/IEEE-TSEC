<p>Conatus is the core technical team of IEEE-TSEC. It provides a platform for technically inclined students to participate in various technical events taking place all over India and to enhance their knowledge. It provides room for gaining and sharing of technical knowledge by interacting with fellow enthusiasts thus enriching them with technical advances. The vision of Conatus is to empower every member with the technical know-how required to be the Future Professional technocrats.<br>
<p>Its aim is to impart a high level understanding of core aspects of technology, craft teams in top form in order to participate and win inter-collegiate technical contests, bag laurels for the society and institution and give students an opportunity to learn more.<br>
<p>The CONATUS team participates in Programming, Web Designing and Technical Paper Presentations, and also in Robotics and Open Hardware contests.

<h2>ECHELON</h2>

<h5>Echelon 2015</h5>
<div>
<p>It was held on March 10, 2015 by the IEEE-TSEC Conatus Team. It comprised of a workshop on Paper Piano.
</p>
<h5>Paper Piano</h5>
<p>Capacitive sensors are sensors which response to touch. Using arduino wand a conductive material we create a touch responsive surface. Any conductor can be used in the construction of a capacitor. In this workshop, graphite, a good conductor of electricity, was used. We sketched a piano on paper with graphite pencil. Individual keys were connected to arduino to make it a capacitive sensor. The keynotes were generated by arduino’s internal crystal clock. The tones were played by touching the pencil drawn keys.

<h5>Echelon 2014</h5>
<div>
<p>It was held on March 7, 2014 by the IEEE-TSEC Conatus Team. It included a workshop to build a Segway Bot.
</p>
<h5>Segway Bot</h5>
<p>A Segway is a two wheel, self-balancing, battery powered electric vehicle. A user commands the Segway by shifting the weight forwards or backwards. A Segway balances by detecting a change in the centre of mass.The bot is constantly moving forwards and backwards against gravity using the principle of reverse pendulum. The bot was built using a module which contained LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and LED (Light Emitting Diode). The module gives varying readings depending on the intensity of light the LDR receives. The light intensity falling on the LDR allows to calculate the distance from the ground. The reading obtained at the upright position is used as a threshold to decide whether the bot will move forward or backward.
</p></div>

<h5>Echelon 2013</h5>
<div>
<p>It was held on the 11th March. It comprised of a workshop on Laser Harp.</p>
<h5>Laser Harp</h5>
<p>It was conducted by the IEEE-TSEC Conatus Team. It was a one day workshop. 
The Arduino Laser Harp is a ‘virtual’ playing surface. Each beam is one note, breaking a beam sounds the note, and releasing it silences it. You can modulate the sound by moving your hand along the beam. 
<p>A laser harp is basically an instrument which somehow resembles a real harp. There are no strings. Instead, beams of laser light are projected from the top of the harp. These beams strike light sensors at the bottom of the frame. When something (a hand, foot, etc.) blocks a beam, a note is triggered on a synthesizer or some type of tone generator.The frame consists of laser diodes attached at the top of the frame and LDRs (light dependent resistors) attached at the bottom. An Arduino microcontroller is used to read the LDR values and accordingly a tone generator (buzzer) is sounded. The buzzer can be programmed to produce sounds of different frequencies.
</div>

<p>Echelon is an odd semester technical festival of IEEE-TSEC Conatus. It comprises of various workshops. These workshops are highly technical. Enthusiastic students turn up to gain extensive knowledge about various aspects of technical hardware 
and components. Echelon has been a truly memorable tradition of IEEE-TSEC, since its inception.<br>
<h4>Echelon 2012</h4>
<div>
<p>It was held on the 2nd and the 3rd of March. It included a workshop on Accelerometer Controlled robot.</p> 
<h4>Accelerometer Controlled robot</h4>
<p>It was conducted by the IEEE-TSEC Conatus officers. It was a two day workshop. The robot followed the instruction by the movement of hand of the person on which the accelerometer was mounted. The robot (a car in this case) had a micro controller unit(MCU) of Arduino Uno (Atmega 328) which processed the signals received by the accelerometer and gave the desired output to the L293D IC circuit that was connected to the motors to provide high current to it, thus driving the robot. The accelerometer used in this process was ADXL335 which is highly accurate. The chasis were of ceramic type and 300 rpm motors were implanted on these chasis. The MCU was serially connected to the computer to give the value of accelerometer.
