<h2><strong>IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY</strong></h2>

<h2><img src="img/IAS.png" alt="" align="center"height="200px"/></h2>
<br />
<p>The IEEE Industry Applications Society (IAS) is one of the world’s
 largest organizations specializing in global design, development, 
 application, and management of electrical and electronic systems, 
 apparatus, devices and controls. </P>
The scope of the Industry Applications Society, 
as a transnational organization, is the advancement 
of the theory and practice of electrical and electronic
 engineering in the development, design, manufacture and 
 application of electrical systems, apparatus, devices and 
 controls to the processes and equipment of industry and commerce;
 the promotion of safe, reliable and economic installations; industry 
 leadership in energy conservation and environmental, health, and safety 
 issues; the creation of voluntary engineering standards and recommended 
 practices; and the professional development of its membership.
<h4>Mission:</h4> 
<p>IEEE IAS strives to promote the advancement of the theory
 and practice of electrical and electronic engineering in the
 development, design, manufacture and application of electrical 
 systems, apparatus, devices and controls to the processes and 
 equipment of industry and commerce; the promotion of safe, 
 reliable and economical installations; industry leadership 
 in energy conservation and environmental health and safety 
 issues; the creation of voluntary engineering standards and
 recommended practices; and the professional development of 
 its membership.</p>
<h4>Vision:</h4>
<p> IAS holds its vision to be a world leader in the 
advancement of technology and dissemination of technical 
information to support professionals engaged in the applications
 of electrical and electronic engineering to industry.</P>

<h2><a name="itias"></a>IEEE-TSEC IAS</h2>

<p>The IAS has one of the largest special interest programs of any IEEE society, which include:
<ul><li>IEEE IAS Annual Meeting</li>
<li>Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition</li>
<li>Applied Power Electronics Conference</li>
<li>Cement Industry Conference</li>
<li>Industrial Energy Efficiency Workshop</li>
<li>and Commercial Power Systems Conference</li>
<li>Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference</li>
<li>Pulp and Paper Industry Conference</li>
<li>Rural Electric Power Industry Conference</li></ul>


<p>IEEE-TSEC IAS holds an Industrial Forum, during the entire year. IEEE-TSEC IAS has a Distinguished Lecturer program, where a noted engineer from IEEE-Mains comes to our college to present a seminar or a conference on current technical innovations.
<h4>INDUSTRIAL FORUM</h4>
<p>The Industrial Forum is the patent of IEEE-TSEC IAS .Industrial Forum basically means that we place the members with a particular firm and the members work on a project given by that particular firm and in return are given a Letter of Appreciation from the firm as well as a certificate of excellence from the society . 

<p>IEEE-TSEC Industry Applications Society holds two festivals during the course of one academic year: TECHTRIX, during the even semester, and FUSION during the odd semester.

<h4>TECHTRIX</h4>
<b>TECHTRIX 2015</b>
    <br><br>
Techtrix 2015 was held on February 14, 2015. IAS this year hosted a workshop titled, MOBILE PHONE TEARDOWN conducted by EDUCATION DEBUNKED. The distinguished speakers for the day were Mr. Deepak Gupta and Ms. Anisha Pillay. The workshop was of reverse engineering of a mobile phone. 
<br><br>
<p>TECHTRIX is an intra- collegiate even semester festival conducted during the month of February. </p>
<p>Techtrix 2014 was held on February 14, 2014. It included of a robotic workshop named Armbotics. The workshop Armbotics was conducted by IEEE-TSEC CONATUS, the technical team of IEEE- TSEC.
</p> 
<ul><li>In the workshop the participants made a level 1 bot and made a robotic arm. The arm is remote controlled and is capable to lift and place objects.</li></ul>

<h4>FUSION</h4>
<p>FUSION is an intra-collegiate festival held during the month of August. It usually consists of a robotics workshop, which is conducted by the CONATUS team of our college, and a fun event. </p>

<p>FUSION 2012 was held on 20th and 21st of August.
<ul><li>On the first day, a workshop was conducted on Grip Bot, its manufacture and working. The workshop was conducted by the Conatus Officers, who are a part of the technical of our college.</li> 
<li>On the second day, a fun event, Automaton Takeover was held. It was a treasure hunt, where the students had to solve clues using their technical skills, to save human kind from the onslaught of the machines.</li><ul>
