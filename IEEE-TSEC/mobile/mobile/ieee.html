<p><b>IEEE</b> is the world’s largest professional association dedicated to advancing technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. <b>IEEE</b>  and its members inspire a global community through its highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and educational activities.
</P>
<p><H4>IEEE Vision Statement:</h4></P>

<p> Be essential to the global technical community and to technical professionals everywhere, and be universally recognized for the contributions of technology and of technical professionals in improving global conditions. 
</P>
<p><H4>IEEE Mission Statement:</h4>
</P>
<p><b>IEEE 's </b> core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.
</P>
<p><b>IEEE</b>  is organized into:
</P>
<ul><li>333 local sections in 10 geographic regions</li>
<li>More than 2,080 chapters comprising of local members with similar technical interests</li>
<li>38 societies and 7 technical councils that compose 10 technical divisions</li>
<li>Nearly 2000 student branches at colleges and universities in 80 countries</li>
<li>More than 530 student branch chapters</li></ul>

<p><b>IEEE</b>  provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences, research, and technology. The goal of the <b>IEEE</b>  education program is to ensure the growth of skill and knowledge in electricity-related technical professions and to foster individual commitment to continuing education among <b>IEEE</b>  members, the engineering and scientific communities, and the general public. Accomplishments in <b>IEEE</b>  technical fields are recognized with annual awards for outstanding contributions to technology, society and the engineering profession. The <b>IEEE</b> Medal of Honor, the <b>IEEE 's </b>highest award, recognizes an individual for an exceptional contribution or extraordinary career in the <b>IEEE</b> fields of interest.
</P>
<p>The <b>IEEE</b> Foundation relies on donations to award grants to new and innovative projects that support a variety of educational, humanitarian, historical preservation, and peer recognition programs of <b>IEEE</b> such as: developing educational and public-information programs to sustain historical research services; subsidized workshops that facilitate the exchange of electronic information; propelling technological innovation; and increasing public awareness about the vast impact of engineering on society. 
</P>
<p><b>IEEE</b> offers educational opportunities such as IEEE eLearning Library, the Education Partners Program, Standards in Education and Continuing Education Units (CEUs).

    <strong><a name="he"></a><h2>Why Join IEEE?</h2></strong>
 <p>Most <B>IEEE</B> members are electrical and electronics engineers, but the organization's wide scope of interests has attracted people in other disciplines as well (e.g., computer science, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, biology, physics, and mathematics).
<p>An individual can join the <B>IEEE</B> as a student member, professional member, or associate member. In order to qualify for membership, the individual must fulfill certain academic or professional criteria and abide to the code of ethics and bylaws of the organization. There are several categories and levels of <B>IEEE</B> membership and affiliation:
<ul><li><h4>Student Members:</h4> Student membership is available for a reduced fee to those who are enrolled in an accredited institution of higher education as undergraduate or graduate students in technology or engineering.</li>
<li><h4>Members: </h4>  Ordinary or professional Membership requires that the individual has graduated from a technology or engineering program of an appropriately accredited institution of higher education or has demonstrated professional competence in technology or engineering through at least six years of professional work experience. An associate membership is available for individuals whose area of expertise falls outside the scope of the <B>IEEE</B> or who does not, at the time of enrollment, meet all the requirements for full membership. Students and Associates have all the privileges of members, except the right to vote and hold certain offices. </li>
<li><h4>Society Affiliates: </h4>  Some <B>IEEE</B> Societies also allow a person who is not an <B>IEEE</B> member to become a Society Affiliate of a particular Society within the <B>IEEE</B>, which allows a limited form of participation in the work of a particular <B>IEEE</B> Society. </li>
<li><h4>Senior Members: </h4>  Upon meeting certain requirements, a professional member can apply for Senior Membership, which is the highest level of recognition that a professional member can directly apply for. Applicants for Senior Member must have at least three letters of recommendation from Senior, Fellow, or Honorary members and fulfill other rigorous requirements of education, achievement, remarkable contribution, and experience in the field. The Senior Members are a selected group, and certain <B>IEEE</B> officer positions are available only to Senior (and Fellow) Members. Senior Membership is also one of the requirements for those who are nominated and elevated to the grade IEEE Fellow, a distinctive honor. </li>
<li><h4>Fellow Members: </h4>  The Fellow grade of membership is the highest level of membership, and cannot be applied for directly by the member – instead the candidate must be nominated by others. This grade of membership is conferred by the <B>IEEE</B> Board of Directors in recognition of a high level of demonstrated extraordinary accomplishment. </li>
<li><h4>Honorary Members: </h4>  Individuals who are not <B>IEEE</B> members but have demonstrated exceptional contributions, such as being a recipient of an IEEE Medal of Honor, may receive Honorary Membership from the <B>IEEE</B> Board of Directors. </li>
<li><h4>Life Members and Life Fellows: </h4>  Members who have reached the age of 65 and whose number of years of membership plus their age in years adds up to at least 100 are recognized as Life Members – and, in the case of Fellow members, as Life Fellows. </li></ul>
<B>IEEE</B> members can access information on local events and activities by signing in to myIEEE, the members' personalized gateway to <B>IEEE</B> membership.
